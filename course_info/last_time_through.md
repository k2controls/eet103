Hello,

Welcome to EET103 Electrical Circuits I, which begins next week!

I’m sending this email so you know what to expect and how to get started. We’ll review everything in detail on the first day of class, but here are the key points:

Canvas Access: Log into the NMC Canvas course to confirm class start times and review the syllabus. If you’re new to Canvas, don’t worry—tutorials are posted at the top of the course page, and we’ll walk through it together in class.

Class Meetings: This is a face-to-face course meeting in PS107, Mondays and Wednesdays, 10:15 AM – 12:15 PM. Attendance is required. While a Zoom link is listed in Canvas, it will only be used as part of our in-person class sessions. I’ll explain how this works on day one.

Technical Help: If you have trouble accessing Canvas, please contact the NMC Help Desk at 231-995-3020.

During our first sessions, we’ll go through the syllabus, tentative schedule, and course requirements.

I look forward to meeting you Monday morning!

Best,
Keith E. Kelly

About the Instructor

I’ve spent my career working at the crossroads of education and technology, helping students and professionals succeed in advanced tech fields. At NMC, I teach in the Engineering and Engineering Technology program and lead projects in computer science, robotics, and the makerspace. I enjoy building things—whether electronics, software, or new learning opportunities—and I look forward to bringing that same hands-on approach into our class.
