## EET103 Electrical Studies I

### [EET103](../../../) - [Sprint 4](../../) - [Week 12](../) - Session 2

**Session 2**


### **1. Review of Capacitor Basics**

* Definition: a device that stores energy in an electric field.
* Units: Farads (F).
* Behavior in DC vs. AC circuits (blocks DC, passes AC).

---

### **2. Capacitive Reactance (( X<sub>C</sub> ))**

* Definition: opposition to AC current flow through a capacitor.
* Formula: X<sub>C</sub> = 1/2πfC
* Units: Ohms (Ω).
* **Frequency dependence**:

  * As ( f ) ↑, ( X<sub>C</sub> ) ↓ → passes higher frequencies more easily.
  * As ( f ) ↓, ( X<sub>C</sub>) ↑ → blocks lower frequencies more.

### **4. RC Filter Configurations**

* **Low-Pass Filter (LPF):**

  * Series resistor, capacitor to ground.
  * Passes **low frequencies**, attenuates **high frequencies**.
  * (f<sub>C</sub> = 1/2πRC)

* **High-Pass Filter (HPF):**

  * Series capacitor, resistor to ground.
  * Passes **high frequencies**, attenuates **low frequencies**.
  * Same cutoff frequency formula.

* LPF: smoothing sensor signals or audio tone shaping.
* HPF: removing DC offset or low-frequency noise.
