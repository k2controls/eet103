## EET103 Electrical Studies I

### [EET103](../) - Sprint 1

- [Week 01](week01)
- [Week 02](week02)
- [Week 03](week03)

#### Overview

This first sprint provides an introduction to the EET103 class and its related resources. You will learn basic circuit concepts and construct simple circuits consisting of a DC voltage source and a load. A digital multimeter will be used to measure continuity, voltage, and current, while you are introduced to series and parallel circuits. This sprint also includes an introduction to soldering.

#### Outcomes
1. Basic Concepts of Electricity
    - Static Electricity
    - Conductors, Insulators, and Electron Flow
    - Electric Circuits
    - Voltage and Current
    - Circuit Load and Resistance
    - Understanding Voltage and Current in Practical Circuits
    - Conventional Versus Electron Flow
    - Digital Multimeter Use

2. Electrical Safety
    - The Importance of Electrical Safety
    - Physiological Effects of Electricity
    - Shock Current Path
    - Safe Practices
    - Emergency Response
    - Common Sources of Hazard
    - Safe Circuit Design
    - Safe Meter Usage
    - Electric Shock Data

#### Sprint Assessment
You will demonstrate your understanding of fundamental DC circuit concepts, including schematic diagram interpretation, circuit construction, circuit analysis, and measurement. You must also submit a video demonstration showcasing the correct construction of your circuit and the proper use of a digital multimeter to measure voltage, current, and resistance. The video must clearly explain each step and highlight safe handling practices.
