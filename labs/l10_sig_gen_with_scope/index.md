2. Determine the frequency range of the XR2206 Precise Function Signal Generator and note the following:

   - Minimum frequency:  __________

   - Maximum frequency:  __________

3. What is the maximum amplitude produced by the function generator? Express and  peak voltage, peak-to-peak voltage, and RMS voltage.

   - Vp: __________

   - Vpp __________

   - V<sub>RMS</sub>:   ________ (note: is this a sine wave?)


4. Describe what an oscilloscope is in your own words.  







5. Explain what is meant by the setting “volts/division.”  




6. Does changing the “volts/division” setting change the amplitude of the displayed signal?  



7. Define what is meant by the setting “seconds/division.”  





5. Record the make and model of the oscilloscope you are using. 


6. Connect the your signal generator to the oscilloscope:
   - Set the frequency to 1000 Hz (1 kHz) and the amplitude to a peak voltage of 1 volt.  
   - Sketch a rough diagram of the displayed waveform below: 
   - Is there distortion at this amplitude

7. Record the following measurements from the oscilloscope:

    
    | Setting/Measurement | Value | Units |
    |--------|--------|------|
    | Volts/division | |   |  
    | Peak voltage| |   |

    | Time Base| |   |   
    | Period| |   |

8. Calculate the RMS voltage.  

9. Adjust your function generator jumpers and/or connections to display square and triangular waves on your scope. Describe what changes in the waveform and what remains the same.

#### Circuit Diagram:

![AC Circuit](ac_circuit.png)

- **R1:** 1 kΩ  
- **R2:** 1 kΩ  
- **Signal:** 2 V peak, 1 kHz  

1. Construct the circuit as shown above. Set the signal to 2 volts peak and 1 kHz.  
2. Is this a series or parallel circuit?  

3. Calculate the peak voltage across **R2**.  

4. Calculate the RMS voltage across **R2**. 


5. Using your oscilloscope:
   - Connect one channel to display the input voltage and the other to display the voltage across **R2**.  
   - *Ensure both channels share a common ground and adjust the display so that both channels use the same zero voltage reference.*  

6. Measure and record the peak voltage across **R2** using the oscilloscope. 

7. Measure and record the RMS voltage across **R2** using the oscilloscope.


9. Measure the AC voltage across **R2** using your DMM. Does the DMM display peak or RMS voltage?  


10. Calculate the RMS current through the circuit.  

11. Calculate the power dissipated by **R2** using the RMS voltage and RMS current.
