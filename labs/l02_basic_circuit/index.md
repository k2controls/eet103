### Demonstration – Load Current and Voltage Using the DMM
Follow along with the instructor as they use the DMM to measure both load voltage and load current.  

---

## Part 1 – Circuit A

1. Select the **active buzzer** from your kit (two buzzers are provided). Use the inventory guide in the kit lid to confirm the active buzzer. The instructor will explain the difference between *active* and *passive* buzzers.  
2. Using the battery holder and test leads, connect a 1.5 V AA battery to the buzzer. Include the momentary pushbutton (from Lab 1). See schematic below:  

   ![AA battery connected to buzzer](circuitA.png)  

3. Test your circuit. Does the buzzer sound when the switch is pressed?  
4. Use the DMM to measure the current draw from the battery. In this circuit:  
   - The buzzer is the **load**.  
   - The AA battery is the **source**.  

   See the second schematic where an ammeter is placed in series with the load.  

   [**AI Prompt:**] What is the typical input resistance of a digital multimeter when used as an ammeter?  

   [**AI Prompt:**] What happens if the DMM is mistakenly connected directly across the source while set as an ammeter?  

5. Set the DMM to measure DC current (see image below). Review the instructor’s demonstration if needed.

6. Press the switch. The buzzer will sound and the current will display on the DMM. Typical values: **20–30 mA**.  
7. Record a short video demonstrating Circuit A, including current measurement and a brief explanation of DMM internal resistance.  

#### Circuit A – Video Checklist (10 pts)

☑ Identify the buzzer correctly  
☑ Show completed circuit and explain wiring  
☑ Demonstrate buzzer operation with switch  
☑ Measure load current with DMM in series, explain process  
☑ Provide clear video explanation of construction, DMM use, and results

## Part 2 – Circuit B

1. Select the DC motor, three AA battery holders, three AA batteries, and the SPDT switch assembly from Lab 1.  
2. Connect three 1.5 V AA batteries in series using the holders. See schematic below:  

   ![Three AA batteries with DC motor](circuitB.png)  

3. Connect one SPDT terminal to the motor and the common terminal to Point A of the circuit.  
4. Test the circuit. Does the motor spin when the toggle switch is turned on? Add a small piece of tape to the motor shaft for visibility.  
5. Use the DMM to measure the **voltage across the motor**. In this circuit:  
   - The motor is the **load**.  
   - The battery pack is the **source**.  

   [**AI Prompt:**] What is the typical input resistance of a digital multimeter when used as a voltmeter?  

   [**AI Prompt:**] What happens if the DMM is mistakenly connected in series with a load while set as a voltmeter?  

6. Move the SPDT switch common to **position B**. Record your observations and motor voltage.  
7. Move the SPDT switch common to **position C**. Record your observations and motor voltage.  
8. Record a short video demonstrating Circuit B, including voltage measurement and a discussion of how adding batteries in series affects circuit voltage.  

#### Circuit B – Video Checklist (10 pts)

☑ Identify motor, batteries, and SPDT switch correctly  
☑ Show completed circuit and explain wiring  
☑ Demonstrate motor operation with switch  
☑ Measure and explain load voltage with DMM  
☑ Provide clear video explanation of circuit operation and measurements

## Part 3 – Circuit C

1. Using the parts from Circuits A and B, construct Circuit C as shown below:  

   ![Three AA batteries with buzzer and DC motor](circuitC.png)  

2. Review your circuit. How should it function? Test your build and compare results with a classmate.  
3. With the switch in **position A**, measure voltage across:  
   - Motor  
   - Buzzer  
4. With the switch in **position B**, measure voltage across:  
   - Motor  
   - Buzzer  
5. Insert the DMM in series to measure total current from the battery pack. Switch between positions A and B.  
   - Compare motor vs buzzer current.  
   - Which draws higher current? Why? (Expected: motor).  
6. Predict current if the switch was removed and both loads were connected directly in parallel.  
7. Record a short video demonstrating Circuit C, including current measurements and explanation of motor vs buzzer load impact.  

#### Circuit C – Video Checklist (15 pts)

☑ Assemble Circuit C correctly from Circuits A and B  
☑ Explain expected behavior before testing  
☑ Demonstrate operation and confirm results  
☑ Measure voltage across motor and buzzer (positions A & B)  
☑ Measure and compare current drawn by motor vs buzzer  
☑ Explain expected current if loads were connected directly (no switch)  
☑ Provide clear video explanation of construction, testing, and results
