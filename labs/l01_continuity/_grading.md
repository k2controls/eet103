| Test Continuity	| Continuity tester! This is not a voltmeter at this point. Show use - connect both leads to show beep and display. Then use on circuit.|

| Describe toggle	|More here - two circuits with common.|

| DMM Test	|	Good but show both circuits on toggle. One is open the other is closed.|
