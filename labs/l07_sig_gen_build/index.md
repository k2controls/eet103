## EET103 Electrical Studies I

### [EET103](../../) - [Labs](../) - Signal Generator  Kit Assembly and Soldering

### Lab 7: Signal Generator Kit Build (XR2206 Function Generator)

Name _____________________________

#### Objectives:
1. Assemble the signal generator kit following Colin’s detailed steps.
2. Test and verify circuit functionality using Colin’s testing procedures.
3. Demonstrate soldering proficiency and circuit troubleshooting techniques.

#### Materials: 
- XR2206 Precise Function Signal Generator Kit  
- Soldering iron and solder  
- PCB holder or vice  
- Flush cutters  
- Multimeter  
- Oscilloscope  
- Power supply - 9V Battery with barrel connector
- **Reference**: [Helpful Colin's Assembly and Instructions](https://helpfulcolin.com/xr2206-function-generator-kit-improved-instructions/)

### Procedure

1. **Review the Schematic and Assembly Instructions**
   - Follow **Helpful Colin’s** instructions for component layout, soldering, and detailed tips for proper assembly.

2. **Component Placement**
   - As per **Helpful Colin’s page**, place smaller components (resistors, diodes, capacitors) first and use the page’s guidance for proper soldering and handling.

3. **Soldering**
   - Colin's page provides excellent soldering techniques and troubleshooting, especially when soldering larger components and ICs. Use it as the reference for this section.

4. **Install the XR2206 Integrated Circuit**
   - Use the guidance from Colin's page to ensure the correct placement of the IC, paying attention to orientation and solder joints.

### Operating and Testing:

1. **Frequency Range and Waveform Adjustment**
   - Follow **Helpful Colin's detailed testing section** for setting the frequency and waveform. This includes testing with an oscilloscope and fine-tuning the waveform using the VR potentiometers.

2. **Oscilloscope Testing**
   - Use the oscilloscope to verify the sine, square, and triangle waveforms and follow **Colin’s guidance** for adjusting any signal distortion or waveform quality issues.

3. **Final Testing**
   - Verify signal consistency across the frequency range and perform final inspections to ensure proper operation.
