- Power supply (Breadboard power supply module)
- Test leads
- EveryCircuit account (link and license key provided)

#### Procedure

This lab will be completed with a partner. However, each student will create their own video presentation, demonstrating the procedures and results.

### Part 1 - Series Circuit Simulation

1. **Investigate Resistors in Series**: Simulate a DC circuit with three resistors connected in series using the EveryCircuit simulator.
   
2. **Select Resistors**: Choose three resistors from your kit:  100Ω, 220Ω, and 330Ω.

3. **Create an EveryCircuit Account**:
   - Use the following link and license key to create your account:
      - [https://everycircuit.com/licensekeyactivation](https://everycircuit.com/licensekeyactivation){:target='_blank'}

   - Simulator available at: [https://everycircuit.com/app](https://everycircuit.com/app){:target='_blank'}
     - Note: The account will expire at the end of this course.

4. **Build the Circuit in EveryCircuit**:
   - Use the components in the toolbar to create the series circuit shown below. Be sure you and your partner use the same resistors in the same locations in the circuit.
   - Add wires by clicking on terminals and dragging them to connect components.
   - Use the wrench icon to adjust the resistor values.
   - Ensure the ground symbol is included for proper simulation.

5. **Simulate Circuit Operation**:
   - Press the space bar to run the simulation and observe current flow and voltage levels.
   - Use the pause and rewind buttons to stop and edit the circuit.

6. **Add Voltmeters**: Add voltmeters across R1 and R2 as shown below to observe the voltage drops.

7. **Record Simulation Results**: Document the voltage drop and current in the table below.

| Component | Value | Voltage Drop | Current |
|-----------|-------|--------------|---------|
| R1        |       |              |         |
| R2        |       |              |         |
| R3        |       |              |         |

8. **Subscript Variables and Measurements**:
   - Understand voltage measurement using subscripts (e.g., V<sub>A</sub> for voltage at point A). For V<sub>BC</sub>, place the common lead at point C and the red lead at point B.
   - Use the test points A, B, and C in the circuit diagram below to complete the table.

| Voltage Variable | Value (V) |
|------------------|-----------|
| V<sub>A</sub>     |           |
| V<sub>B</sub>     |           |
| V<sub>C</sub>     |           |
| V<sub>AB</sub>    |           |
| V<sub>BC</sub>    |           |
| V<sub>AC</sub>    |           |
| V<sub>CB</sub>    |           |

### Part 2 - Series Circuit Construction and Measurement

1. **Inspect Resistors**: Examine the three resistors selected in Part 1.
   - Record their nominal values.
   - Use an AI prompt or manual reference to determine the color code for each resistor.
   - Measure the actual resistance using the DMM.

| Component | Nominal Value | Color Code | Measured Value |
|-----------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| R1        |               |            |                |
| R2        |               |            |                |
| R3        |               |            |                |

2. **Breadboard Overview**:
   - Watch the video on breadboard usage: [How to Use a Breadboard](https://youtu.be/6WReFkfrUIk?si=2-5YteJZhcv01EYE){:target='_blank'}
   - Watch the video on using the breadboard power supply module: [Using an MB-102 Breadboard Power Supply Module](https://youtu.be/wGqubnEC-Ow?si=dtNQJz_UMcKfe5SH){:target='_blank'}

3. **Construct the Series Circuit**:
   - Work with your partner to build the series circuit from Part 1 on a breadboard. Refer to the schematic and plan component layout carefully.

4. **Validate Circuit Build**: Have your partner verify your circuit construction before applying power.

5. **Energize and Measure**:
   - Use the DMM to measure the circuit’s current and the voltage drop across each resistor. Remember to measure current in series and voltage in parallel.

6. **Record Your Results**:

| Component | Value | Voltage Drop | Current |
|-----------|-------|--------------|---------|
| R1        |       |              |         |
| R2        |       |              |         |
| R3        |       |              |         |
