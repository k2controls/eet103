## EET103 Electrical Studies I

### [EET103](../../) - [Sprint 2](../) - Midterm Exam Specification

The midterm consist of 25 questions including both multiple-choice and fill-in questions. It covers basic circuits including series, parallel, and and basic series-parallel. You must be able to use your scientific calculator including metric prefixes and respond to questions concerning correct DMM use.

The following is a list of concepts included in EET103 that are included in the midterm test.
1. Ohm's Law and Power Law
    - V = I x R
    - P = I x V
    - other related Algebraic forms (i.e. P = I<sup>2</sup> x R) 
2. Series Circuits
    - Total resistance give multiple resistors
    - Current flow
    - Voltage drops across individual resistors
    - Power dissipation
    - KVL concepts (voltage drops add)
3. Parallel Circuits
    - Total resistance give multiple resistors
    - Total current flow along with individual branch currents 
    - Voltage drops across branches
    - Power dissipation
    - KCL concepts (branch currents add)
4. Series-Parallel Circuits
    - Total resistance give multiple resistors
    - Total current flow along with individual branch currents 
    - Voltage drops across individual resistors or branches.
