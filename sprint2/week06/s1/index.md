- [Quiz 3 review](https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPageV2.aspx?origin=NeoPortalPage&subpage=design&collectionid=n11gwqsxu7fopf84cx7kng&id=7d-nLF6sb0SVV1dHONw2EJ6w58fEsdNChe_qBQ1MBUdUNks0S1ZUS08yVFhBN0cySFJFVEJNWkxYTi4u){:target='_blank'}

- [Worksheet 1 review](https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPageV2.aspx?origin=NeoPortalPage&subpage=design&collectionid=n11gwqsxu7fopf84cx7kng&id=7d-nLF6sb0SVV1dHONw2EJ6w58fEsdNChe_qBQ1MBUdUOTBQMTg1MUVSTFlRUEJPVDY0UTZLUktWQS4u){:target='_blank'}


- [Parallel Circuits](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-5/simple-parallel-circuits/){:target='_blank'}
    - Voltage is the same across each branch (Current was the same in Series)
    - Total current is the sum of branch currents - *KCL*
        - (*KVL* - Total voltage was the sum of voltage drops in Series)
    - Total power is sum of individual power (same in Series)
    - Total resistance in parallel
        - Less than any individual branch
        - Yes, this works...

        - but, I prefer product-over-the-sum. *(only works for two resistors)*

        ![alt text](product-over-sum.png)

        - What is the total R of two 1K in parallel?
        - What is the total R of three 1K in parallel?
