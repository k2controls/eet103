- Resistance and Ohm's Law - [Chapter 2](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-2/voltage-current-resistance-relate/){:target='_blank'}

    - [How Voltage, Current, and Resistance Relate](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-2/voltage-current-resistance-relate/){:target='_blank'}
    
    - [Power in Electric Circuits](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-2/power-electric-circuits/){:target='_blank'}

    - [AI Prompt:] - Can you plot this data for me?

        | Current	| Voltage |
        |-----------|---------|	
        | 0.22 A    |	0.66 V |	
        | 0.47 A    |	1.42 V |	
        | 0.85 A    |	2.54 V |	
        | 1.05 A    |	3.16 V |	
        | 1.50 A    |	4.51 V |	
        | 1.80 A    |	5.41 V |	
        | 2.00 A    |	5.99 V |	
        | 2.51 A    |	7.49 V |	

    - [AI Prompt] - How does this data relate to Ohm's Law?

    - If power is voltage times current **P = V x R** or the square of the current times the resistance **P = I^2 R** then what is happening to power dissipation in the generated graph?

    - [AI Prompt:] - Can you plot power for this resistor given the current in the graph?

    - [Nonlinear Conduction](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-2/nonlinear-conduction/){:target='_blank'}

        - One style of light bulb, very different from the ïncandescent” design which works on the principle of a super-heated wire filament emitting light, is called a gas discharge tube. In this design of light bulb, light is produced by the direct ëxcitation” of gas molecules as electric current passes between two electrodes:

            ![alt text](bulbs.png)

        - Both types of light bulbs have interesting voltage/current plots, neither one being identical to the voltage/current plot of a resistor. First, the voltage/current plot for an incandescent light bulb:

        ![alt text](i_bulb_graph.png)

        - Next, the voltage/current plot for a gas-discharge light bulb:

        ![alt text](g_bulb_graph.png)

        - Based on these two graphs, what can you say about the electrical resistance of each bulb type over its operating range?

        - Given what you know about power dissipation,which lamp is more efficient?
