- Quiz 2 review(https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPageV2.aspx?origin=NeoPortalPage&subpage=design&collectionid=n11gwqsxu7fopf84cx7kng&id=7d-nLF6sb0SVV1dHONw2EJ6w58fEsdNChe_qBQ1MBUdUMlY0TjgzMEVOVFJOSkRaQ0cyVEtWV0NXUC4u&topview=Presentation){:target='_blank'}


- Additional Series review
    1. Flashlight Circuit (Cells in Series + Lamp)
        - 3×AA batteries (1.5 V each) in series → 4.5 V total
        - Internal resistance: 0.2 Ω per cell → 0.6 Ω total  ![alt text](Figure_6.webp)
        - Lamp: ~20 Ω

    2. Two LEDs in Series + Resistor
        - Supply: 9 V battery
        - LEDs: 2× red (Vf ≈ 2.0 V each)
        - If = 15 mA
        - What is the value of current limiting R?

- Use a shunt to measure load current.

![alt text](shunt_resistor.png)

    - Inspect the power resistor provided by the instructor.
    - Measure the actual value with your ohmmeter.
    - Based on the size, what assumption can you make about the power rating of this device?
    - Place the resistor in series with the motor load. Consider this a shunt resistor. 
    - Apply 9V (or 5V is 9V is not available). Measure the voltage drop across the resistor and determine the load current.
    - Does inserting this shunt resistor change the circuit? What improvements could be made?

- [Parallel Circuits](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-5/simple-parallel-circuits/){:target='_blank'}
    - Voltage is the same across each branch (Current was the same in Series)
    - Total current is the sum of branch currents (Total voltage was the sum of voltage drops in Series)
    - Total power is sum of individual power (same in Series)
    - Total resistance in parallel
        - Less than any individual branch
        - Yes, this works...

        ![alt text](parallel_total_R.png)

        - but, I prefer product-over-the-sum. *(only works for two resistors)*

        ![alt text](product-over-sum.png)

        - What is the total R of two 1K in parallel?
        - What is the total R of three 1K in parallel?

- Introduction: [Lab 4 - Parallel Circuits](../../labs/l04_parallel_circuits/){:target='_blank'} (due next week)
