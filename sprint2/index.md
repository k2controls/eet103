## EET103 Electrical Studies I

### [EET103](../) - Sprint 2

- [Week 4](week04)
- [Week 5](week05)
- [Week 6](week06)

#### Overview

In this sprint, you'll deepen your understanding of DC circuits, extending from basic resistive circuits to series, parallel, and series-parallel combinations. You will apply Ohm’s Law and Kirchhoff's Laws to analyze, construct, and troubleshoot circuits. Simulations and hands-on activities will reinforce your skills in circuit analysis and measurement.

#### Sprint Assessment

You will demonstrate your understanding of DC circuit analysis, focusing on Ohm's Law, Power Law, series, parallel, and series-parallel circuits. Building upon skills from Sprint 1, you’ll apply circuit construction, schematic interpretation, and measurement techniques to more complex circuits. Additionally, you will submit a video demonstrating the correct construction of your circuit, the proper use of a digital multimeter, and the application of Kirchhoff’s Voltage and Current Laws (KVL and KCL).
